# DeckSkinsPlus
 A mod for Balatro that enables full deck customization for the Customize Deck menu, allowing new textures for not just the face cards, but every card in your deck. This mod will find all .lua files inside the /skins/ directory in this mod's folder and load each of them as an additional option in the Customize Decks menu.
